getPoster.rm
===========

This application takes the name of a Movie or TV show

It then runs a search from freecovers.net and pulls back all of the results for that string on the first page

It parses all of the results and compares the names to the user inputted string

Once it has iterated through all of the results it returns the closest match and the image that is associated with that math

It also crops the image to be 282px X 400px so it can be used as an image for the WDTV Live
